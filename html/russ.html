            <h2>Title: SMILE<br>
                By: Russel Bonaga
            </h2>
            <p>
                The art that I made is about a character in One Piece Animated Character known as Ronoroa Zoro. Who lived in his dreams to become a Greatest Swordsman in the world.
                He doesn't care about somethings. But there is only one thing that will made him smile. Which is doing some battles, fighting strong people that made his satisfaction.
                I used paint brush, pencil to do the scratch and also a pen to highlight the character and also some oil pastel.</p>
        </div>

        <script>
            function myFunction(smallImg)
            {
                var fullImg = document.getElementById("imageBox")
                fullImg.src = smallImg.src;
            }
        </script>
